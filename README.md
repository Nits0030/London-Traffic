## London-Traffic
This project focuses on transport data extracted and analyzes its impact over the year and evaluation through analysis of results using statistical approach.

## DataSet
The data analyzed in this study derives from the historical statistics database of the UK Department of Transport  covering the period from 2005  to 2016 for all the regions of United Kingdom which consists of around 275,386 rows. The data is collected is in csv format which is stored on MongoDB which is hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and is the extracted in R studio to perform the statistical tests on the dataset. 
The data consists of dependent and independent variable. Severity of accidents being the dependent variable, the independent variables are road types, weather ,speed limit, time of accidents. The data is analyzed to identify the factors affecting the road accidents and identifying which cities in UK have major road accidents.

## Data Analysis 
The examination focus is on the whole UK transport database identifying high severity road incident and checking the accidents over time, identifying the area of where these incidents takes place. Considering various factors that affect the occurrences such as measuring the time of accident, weather conditions, and kind of roads to draw inferences. 
Historic data analysis is used to analyze the transport data to identify the various reasons for the incidents occurring in the major cities in United Kingdom.

## Data Description 
The dataset includes various categorial variables which are the factors that are probably the cause of the road accidents. Over the years, there have been a general increase in number of accidents as reported by UK Department of Transport. 
## Time Series analysis 
Therefore, a time series analysis is utilized in order to observe the accidents count of how it moves along the period. The decomposition is used to extract the trend and cyclical component, in order to identify if the month and season could be important predictors based on a common assumption of road accidents that take place elsewhere
